# Fansclub Esport Platform

A digital platform for an e-sports fan club that manages paid membership applications, QR-based membership verification, and content management for news and merchandise. The system is designed with a clear separation between public pages, member-only features, and a secured admin dashboard.

---

## Project Summary

This project is an end-to-end membership management system for an e-sports fan club. It covers public content delivery, structured member onboarding with payment proof validation, QR-based identity verification, and an isolated admin panel with immutable audit logs.

The repository serves as an engineering case study and production-grade Laravel application, not as an academic or peer-reviewed research paper.

### Manual Setup (Step-by-Step)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zygmacore/e-sport.git
cd e-sport
```

#### 2. Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### 3. Enter the Laravel Container

```bash
docker exec -it laravel_app bash
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

#### 5. Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Edit the `.env` file with your local values:

```env
APP_NAME="Fansclub Esport"
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret

SESSION_DRIVER=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.your_host.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_smtp_user
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=no-reply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Fansclub Esport"
```

#### 6. Database Migration & Seeding

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=SettingsSeeder
```

Run additional seeders (e.g., `DatabaseSeeder`) if demo data is required.

#### 7. Build Frontend & Run Server

```bash
npm run dev
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

Use `npm run build` for production assets.

## Local Access

* **Laravel Application**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* **phpMyAdmin**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

    * Username: `root`
    * Password: `secret`

## Demo Accounts / How to Try

There is no default admin account.

Create an admin user manually using Tinker:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> \App\Models\User::create([
...     'name' => 'Admin Demo',
...     'email' => 'admin@example.com',
...     'password' => bcrypt('secret'),
...     'role' => 'admin',
...     'status' => 'active',
... ]);
```

---

## Additional Commands

**Restart containers**

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

**Access MySQL container**

```bash
docker exec -it mysql_laravel mysql -u root -p
```
